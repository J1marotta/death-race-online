# Death Race Progress

Last updated: 2026-07-07

## Current State

- Active workspace: `C:\Users\James\Documents\Code\deathRace`
- Old workspace: `C:\Users\James\Documents\death race`
- Stack: React + Vite + JavaScript modules + npm + Oxlint
- Git branch: `codex/task-01-network-scope`
- Initial commit: `45b2434 Initial Death Race project setup`
- Planning cleanup commit: `d59ecfb Clean up project planning docs`
- The app still shows the default Vite starter UI.
- Dependencies are installed locally.
- Build output goes to `dist`, which is ignored by git.
- The old workspace currently contains only a `.git` folder.
- No Defender source files have been found in the active repo.
- Remote origin is `https://github.com/J1marotta/death-race-online.git`.

## Completed

- Created/moved the active project to `C:\Users\James\Documents\Code\deathRace`.
- Initialized git in the active project folder.
- Created the React + Vite project structure.
- Added npm scripts for `dev`, `build`, `lint`, and `preview`.
- Added Oxlint configuration.
- Installed dependencies.
- Recovered the concrete MVP from the attached pasted text.
- Cleaned the planning docs into separate roles:
  - `spec.md`: design source of truth.
  - `progress.md`: completed work and current state.
  - `todo.md`: remaining work.
- Replaced the default Vite README with a minimal project README.
- Removed the redundant `CHAT_GAME_CONTEXT.md` handoff after moving its useful content into the core docs.
- Recorded the `1200px` laptop presentation target.
- Recorded the Defender preservation guardrail.
- Made the initial baseline commit.
- Added GitHub remote origin.

## Verification

- `npm run lint` passed on 2026-07-07 after docs cleanup.
- `npm run build` passed on 2026-07-07 after docs cleanup.
- Confirmed the active repo has baseline commit `45b2434`.
- Confirmed the old workspace currently contains only `.git`.
- Confirmed no filenames in the active repo contain `defender`, `defence`, or `defense`.

## Guardrails

- Do not overwrite, replace, delete, or casually refactor existing Defender code.
- If Defender code exists elsewhere, locate it and document its source files before changing gameplay code.
- Keep generated folders and logs out of commits unless there is a specific reason to include them.
- Keep commits small and stable after the baseline.

## Task Log

### task 01 : Decide Network Scope Before Multiplayer Code

- Decision: implement the MVP first as a local/single-browser prototype with mocked lobby UI and local simulated players.
- Reason: the playable hidden-identity loop can be built and tested without prematurely choosing backend, deployment, websocket, or persistence architecture.
- Architecture note: keep lobby/player/round state modular so a real-time transport can replace the mock/local layer later.
- Updated `spec.md` and `todo.md` to reflect the decision.
- Tests run: `npm run lint`; `npm run build`.
- /usage: tokensUsed 196662, timeUsedSeconds 85.

### task 02 : Decide Backend Choice

- Decision: use no backend for the first playable loop; keep MVP state local and in-memory.
- Reason: this matches the local/single-browser prototype scope and keeps the team focused on validating the hidden-identity racing loop before selecting backend, websocket, persistence, or deployment architecture.
- Architecture note: lobby, player, and round state should still be modular so a backend transport can replace the local state layer later.
- Updated `spec.md` and `todo.md` to reflect the decision.
- Tests run: `npm run lint`; `npm run build`.
- /usage: tokensUsed 206144, timeUsedSeconds 152.

### task 03 : Decide Deployment Target

- Decision: use no deployment target for the first playable loop; develop and verify locally with Vite dev/preview.
- Reason: deployment should follow the playable loop and backend/networking decisions, not lead them.
- Architecture note: keep the app as a normal Vite build so a static host or later full-stack host can be chosen without reshaping the game.
- Updated `spec.md` and `todo.md` to reflect the decision.
- Tests run: `npm run lint`; `npm run build`.
- /usage: tokensUsed 212065, timeUsedSeconds 198.

### task 04 : Decide Mobile Tablet Support

- Decision: target desktop/laptop for MVP; defer mobile and tablet controls until the `1200px` laptop loop works.
- Reason: the recovered design is built around 20 no-scroll lanes, mouse aiming, visible crosshairs, `Space`, and `Left Shift`, so desktop/laptop is the cleanest first playable target.
- Updated `spec.md` and `todo.md` to reflect the decision.
- Tests run: `npm run lint`; `npm run build`.
- /usage: tokensUsed 217439, timeUsedSeconds 253.
